When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You would want to use a remote repository in order to share code with other people. 
A public repository allows you to do open source development and, for proprietary 
code, a private repository gives a team a way to share and review code. Even for 
solo work it allows access to the code from multiple machines.
